### 📜 **About the Repository**

This repository contains a custom deep learning architecture for **generating text as images**, where each character is created using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). Unlike typical text rendering engines, this system mimics the process of "drawing" characters using a neural approach, offering full control over style, and layout.

---

### 🧠 **Core Architecture**

The system is split into two main components:

1. 🧬 **Character Generator (cGAN-based):**  
   Learns how to generate individual characters as pixel images, conditioned on the ASCII or token input.

2. 🧠 **Control Networks:**  
   Custom neural modules that:
   - Decide spacing and layout
   - Control timing of generation
   - Determine where and when each character is drawn

These modules work together to render complete text, character by character, like a human hand guided by thought.

---

### ⚙️ **Key Features**

- ✅ **Character-Level Control:**  
  Each letter is generated individually, allowing for dynamic font generation or stylized handwriting.

---

- cGANs are trained to draw each character
- Control modules define spatial position

### 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
